Node.js binding for lmdb

lmdb is an extremely fast and lightweight database, you can find more info about it here: http://symas.com/mdb
The aim of this node module is to provide bindings so that people can use lmdb from their node applications, aiming for a simple and clean API which is on par with the lmdb API but tries to apply javascript patterns and naming conventions as much as possible to make users feel familiar about it.
